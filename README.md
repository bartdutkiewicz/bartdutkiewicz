# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Economist (M.Sc.) with years of experience and great interest in data | Graduate Data Science & AI Bootcamp at Le Wagon (June 2025) | Statistics & Data Science, Python, R, SQL, Dashboards, Data Warehouse | Curious and always willing to think outside the box.

My mission is a strong, reliable and above all employee-friendly reporting system. Data architecture, data flow, automation and good presentation and, above all, accessibility in data input and evaluation are my main interests and goals.

I am interested and experienced in the fields of health, official statistics, agricultural statistics and bioeconomy from my previous work and studies.

I also enjoy providing professional and technical advice and support.
